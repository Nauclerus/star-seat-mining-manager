/**
 * The weekly "who still owes" summary for directors.
 *
 * Every other tax notification speaks to one member about one debt. Nothing
 * gave a director the whole picture, so an invoice that slipped past the
 * per-member notifications simply went unnoticed: no Discord on that member, a
 * delivery that failed quietly, or a gap in the matching. This is the backstop
 * that makes any of those visible without anyone having to go looking.
 *
 * Reports what is LEFT to pay, never the original charge, and shows how much of
 * each debt is already covered so a director can tell a member who has paid 95%
 * from one who sent a token 1m and stopped.
