/**
 * Daily integrity check: walks moon_extractions, computes the expected
 * `status` value via the model's canonical lifecycle helpers, and warns
 * (or auto-corrects with --fix) when the persisted status disagrees.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The plugin has two pieces of code that decide a chunk's lifecycle
 * position:
 *
 *   1. `MoonExtractionService::determineStatus()` — runs at ESI import
 *      time, computes the status that gets persisted on the row.
 *
 *   2. `MoonExtraction::scopeExpiredByTime()` + the live helpers
 *      (`isReady()`, `isUnstable()`, `getExpiryTime()`) — used by the UI
 *      and downstream consumers at read time.
 *
 * The two should agree. But the original determineStatus() treated
 * `natural_decay_time` (the auto-fracture mark, ~3h after chunk arrival)
 * as the chunk's expiry, while the model helpers correctly use
 * `fractured_at + 50h`. Result: every chunk got stamped `status='expired'`
 * ~3h after arrival while still being mineable for 50 more hours; cron
 * Pass 2 skipped them and the moon_chunk_unstable warning never fired.
 *
 * The determineStatus() bug was fixed in commit 0997dd0. This command
 * exists as a permanent backstop:
 *
 *   - Catches the *next* divergence — any future logic change in either
 *     pathway that drifts apart will surface here within 24h.
 *   - Self-heals rows that got mis-stamped before the deploy (so installs
 *     upgrading from a broken version don't have to babysit a SQL recipe).
 *   - Provides an operator-runnable artisan tool when the diagnostic page
 *     says "active extractions = N" and that number looks wrong.
 *
 * The check is read-only by default. Pass `--fix` to flip mis-stamped
 * rows to the computed status (logged at INFO level per row changed).
 *
 * Scheduled daily via `ScheduleSeeder` (`0 3 * * *` — 03:00 UTC, off the
 * top of the hour to avoid colliding with hourly polls).
