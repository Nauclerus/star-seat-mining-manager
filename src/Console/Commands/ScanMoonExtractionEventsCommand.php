/**
 * Scans active moon extractions and publishes lifecycle events to Manager
 * Core's EventBus exactly once per stage per extraction.
 *
 * Stages:
 *   - ready    : chunk has fractured, fleet-able window opens (48h, or 72 / 96h
 *                with a moon rig)
 *   - unstable : final 2h capital-safety window before expiry
 *   - expired  : window closed, no more mining
 *
 * Per-stage dedup is enforced via the `moon_extraction_event_log` table.
 * Each stage column (e.g. `ready_published_at`) is NULL until the event
 * has been published, then stamped with NOW(). The scanner re-runs are
 * idempotent: an already-stamped stage is skipped.
 *
 * Standalone-safe: with Manager Core absent the publisher returns false
 * for every call, the log row never gets stamped, and the scanner reports
 * zero publishes. No errors, no log noise.
 *
 * Designed to run on a 5-minute cron. The latency floor between the
 * extraction transitioning state and the event firing is therefore ~5 min,
 * which is plenty for the consumer's purposes (FC formup planning, not
 * tick-accurate alarms).
