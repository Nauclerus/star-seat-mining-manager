/**
 * SeAT v5 schedule seeder for Mining Manager's cron commands.
 *
 * Inherits the canonical `firstOrCreate` semantics from
 * `AbstractScheduleSeeder::run()`: NEW installs get every schedule from
 * `getSchedules()` inserted into `schedules`; existing installs keep
 * whatever's already there. This is the pattern every SeAT plugin uses.
 *
 * Why we don't override `run()` to force-update existing rows:
 *   - The schedules table is part of the operator's control surface.
 *     Operators routinely customise cron expressions for their install
 *     (different timezone, less aggressive ESI rate, paused commands by
 *     setting expression='', etc.). Forcibly overwriting those on every
 *     plugin boot is user-hostile and contrary to SeAT conventions.
 *   - `AbstractScheduleSeeder` is explicit about the no-reconciliation
 *     contract.
 *
 * For deprecation (renaming/removing a command), use
 * `getDeprecatedSchedules()` below — `AbstractScheduleSeeder::run()`
 * deletes those rows during the seed pass.
 *
 * For changing an existing command's cron expression in a future release:
 * the canonical pattern is "old → deprecated, new → fresh insert" via the
 * two methods. The plugin SHOULD NOT silently rewrite cron rows that an
 * operator may have intentionally customised.
