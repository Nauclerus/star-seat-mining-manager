Idempotent (never mutates production data) so you can run it anytime. Recommended after every plugin upgrade, settings change, or when you suspect something\'s broken — it catches stale route caches, missing migrations, broken cross-plugin links, and partial deploys before they cause real-world dispatch failures.

Useful for installs that want a human-review step before any tax balance moves on the books — multi-corp setups where the director wants to verify each match, or environments with strict audit requirements. Even with auto-match OFF, the dedup tracking still records every match so the same transaction never re-credits.',
