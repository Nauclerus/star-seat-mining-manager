/**
 * Takes planned pulls off the calendar for refineries the corporation no
 * longer owns, but only once it is sure they are gone.
 *
 * A pull on a refinery you do not own cannot happen, so leaving it planned only
 * misleads. A refinery that is still there is never touched, even with its moon
 * drill unfitted or an unanchor running: both can change back, and the planner
 * marks them instead.
 *
 * A structure can also drop out of SeAT's list for an afternoon when ESI or the
 * server has a bad day, and a month of planning should not vanish because of
 * one bad sync. So a refinery has to be missing on three sightings at least
 * twelve hours apart, a day at the very least, and seen back in between starts
 * the count again.
 *
 * Covers every pull still ahead, blueprint or planned by hand. Blueprint slots
 * are left where they are: a pattern is built by hand, and clearing it is the
 * Blueprints tab's button.
