/**
 * What kind of ore a type id is, for tax and for reporting.
 *
 * TypeIdRegistry holds the ids. It says which ids are Bitumens and which are
 * Hezorime, and that is all it should ever say. Which tax category an ore falls
 * under is policy, not data, and it lives here.
 *
 * This used to be six copies. ProcessMiningLedgerCommand, ImportCharacter-
 * MiningCommand, BackfillOreTypeFlagsCommand, EventMiningAggregator,
 * LedgerSummaryService and TaxCalculationService each carried their own version
 * of the same ordered checks. They were written from each other and had already
 * drifted: five answered "moon" for a moon ore with no rarity on file while the
 * sixth answered "moon_r4", which is a real tax rate.
 *
 * There are two vocabularies here and they are deliberately different. The
 * mining_ledger.ore_category column stores "abyssal" and "triglavian"; the tax
 * rate settings are keyed "abyssal_ore" and "triglavian_ore". Both are already
 * in stored data and operator settings, so neither can be quietly renamed to
 * match the other.

     *
     * Mutanite is ongoing, but it cannot be reprocessed and a price source
     * often has no price for it. Counted, it went into the ledger as regular
     * ore through the fallback in category(), usually worth nothing, which
     * says nothing true about it.
     *
     * Both are skipped at import, so nothing further along ever sees them.
     * Only mining imported after this check exists is affected. Rows already in
     * a ledger stay as they were, like every other change to how ore is treated.
